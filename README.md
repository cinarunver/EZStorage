# Simple Storage

Simple storage mod for Minecraft 26.2 (NeoForge).

> This branch is a port of the 1.7.10 (Forge/GTNH) version. See [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) for what changed.

## Description

Simple Storage (former EZStorage) introduces an early-game storage system that scales and evolves as players progress, while keeping the vanilla flair. Want to put 100k Cobblestone in 1 slot? No problem. The blocks in the mod can add a crafting grid, additional storage, and more. Also includes integration into some mods for easier crafting or additional features!

## Blocks & Items

- **Storage Core**
  - This is the core of your storage system
  - Click on this block to open the GUI (search box included), and add adjacent blocks to expand
  - Each system can only have 1 Storage Core
  - This block can only be broken if it contains no items
- **Storage Box**
  - Tier 1 storage add-on wich increases the storage capacity of the Storage Core by a small amount
- **Condensed Storage Box**
  - Tier 2 storage add-on
- **Hyper Storage Box**
  - Tier 3 storage add-on
- **Proxy Port**
  - Expose the storage inventory to hoppers, conduits, machines and AE2 storage bus
- **Crafting Box**
  - This adds a crafting grid to the GUI of your Storage Core (compatible with NEI + clicking for easy crafting from the internal inventory)
- **Portable Storage Panel**
  - This adds a small item that features a wood panel with wireless access to your storage core. It's tier can be upgraded and a crafting grid can also be added.
  - Upgrade by putting in crafting grid together with one redstone block and the upgrade item (ender pearl, ender eye, nether star, crafting box)
  - No need for chunkloading the target storage core, it works without!
  - Keybinds (unbound by default) open the storage of a panel in your inventory or pick the looked-at block from it

## Mod Integration

- **JEI**
  - Recipe transfer ("+") into the crafting grid, taking items from storage first
  - Recipe/usage lookup (R/U) on stored items
  - Optional search box synchronisation
- **Automation**
  - The Inventory Proxy exposes the storage through NeoForge's item capability, so hoppers, pipes and storage buses can use it

## Remarks

This mod is intented to be a compact storage solution, and not an automated storage network. As of right now, I'm not going to include any features like filtered output, network cables, external monitors, or anything else remeniscent of Applied Energistics. If you have an idea how such features would fit nicely in vanilla worlds, feel free to open an issue for discussion.

As from my side, this mod is feature-completed. I'll try fixing bugs as they were found or make improvements where possible. However, any contribution in form of troubleshooting or pull requests for bugfixes, improvements, mod compat, or new features are welcome at any time.

## Contribution

Feel free to open PRs for features, improvements, or compatibility fixes. I'm maintaining this at minimal effort for use on my server/modpack.

## Changes compared to the original version of EZStorage

This fork becomes some changes to be usable on servers, less-buggy and a lot of feature and code improvements.

- Many bugfixes and some stability and code improvements
- Lots of UI and performance improvements
- Mod compat with NEI, Waila, Jabba, Crafting Tweaks, Et Futurum Requiem, etc.
- Re-made the most textures to look nicer and fit better into vanilla worlds
- Replaced input and output block with a more enhanced proxy block
- Configurable maximum different item types per storage (no limit by default)
- Store storage as separated file in the world's save directory instead directly on the TileEntity (only send to client when needed)

## Development

Requires Java 25. `./gradlew build` builds the mod, `./gradlew runClient` starts a dev client (with JEI).
`./gradlew runSelftest` and `./gradlew runSelftestClient` run the in-game self tests that CI uses.
